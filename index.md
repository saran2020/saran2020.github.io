## About Me
I’m Saran, An Android developer with 5+ years of experience in developing Native Android apps 👨‍💻, along with some Backend. Currently, I am building and scaling  <a target="_blank" href="http://fi.money"><img src="/assets/images/fi_image.png" alt="flowers"></a>  from 0 to 10 million+ users and beyond.

Outside of work, I enjoy listening to hip-hop music 🎧 and spending my time on treks 🏃‍♂️.
