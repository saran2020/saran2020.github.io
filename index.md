## About Me
I’m Saran! I love computers and enjoy building stuff – I’m lucky that I get to do it as my job. I currently work from Bengaluru as an Android Developer at [epiFi](https://epifi.com/) helping them with my Android skills to build a banking platform.

I love tinkering and playing around with UI and enjoy creating fancy animations on Android during some of my free time. Recently, I have started exploring backend frameworks like Django using Python. 

Apart from computers, I enjoy listening to hip-hop music ❤️, poems and swimming.

You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SankaranDev) for a chat.
